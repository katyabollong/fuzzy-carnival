Creative Advertising, and double minoring in Art Practices, and
CTD! My pronouns are she/her/hers. What I hope to gain from this
course is to have a better understanding of coding and website
development, and to hopefully feel more comfortable with coding
in general. My hobbies include digital art and photography!>
